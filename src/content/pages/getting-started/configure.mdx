import Aside from '/src/components/Aside.astro'

Once you have your astropad running, your first step is to do some basic configuration to make it your own. All site configuration is stored in a single file located at **\_data/site.json**.

If you have a local copy of your site installed you can edit this file directly, or you can edit and commit the file using the Github UI. The default **site.json** file looks like so:

```json
{
  "name": "Astropad",
  "subtitle": "Create a modern notebook to document or explain almost anything.",
  "description": "Create a modern notebook to document or explain almost anything with Astropad",
  "footer": "<a href='https://astro.build'>Made with ‚ù§ by the Astro</a>",
  "url": "https://spacebook.app",
  "githubUrl": "https://github.com/broeker/spacebook",
  "githubBranch": "main"
}
```

## Basic settings

When you make changes to this file and deploy them, your site will automically update to reflect your new settings:

- **name** -- this is the name or title of your site as it appears in the header
- **subtitle** _(optional)_ -- this is the short subtitle that appears directly below your site name
- **description** -- this is used as your default metadata page description, and can be overridden on a page-by-page basis as needed
- **footer** _(optional)_ -- this is the plain text that appears in the bottom footer
- **githubUrl** -- this is the address to your Github repository, used to generate edit links
- **githubBranch** -- this is the main of your primary Github branch (set to "main" by default)
