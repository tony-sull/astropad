# Editor Setup

Customize your code editor to improve the Astropad writing experience.

## Official Astro Plugin

Check out the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/editor-setup/) for deatils on setting up your favorite code editor with Astro's language tools.

For Astropad, we also recommend installing MDX language tools. There's an official [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) extension for MDX if that's your jam - the MDX community is growing fast so there's likely an extension for your favorite editor setup!

## Other tools

### Prettier

Astropad includes [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) out of the box, pre-configured with the [official Astro prettier plugin](https://github.com/withastro/prettier-plugin-astro).

<Aside type='caution' aria-label="Using with pnpm">
Due to upstream issues inside Prettier, the plugin will not be automatically detected when using pnpm. In order to make it find the plugin, the following parameter needs to be added when running Prettier:

```bash
prettier --write --plugin-search-dir=. .
```

Additional settings are also required when using Prettier inside VS Code. See the pluginâ€™s README for more information.
