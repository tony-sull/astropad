# Editor Setup

Customize your code editor to improve the Astropad writing experience.

## Official Astro Plugin

Check out the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/eidtor-setup/) for deatils on setting up your favorite code editor with Astro's language tools.

For Astropad, we also recommend installing MDX language tools. There's an official [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) extension for MDX if that's your jam - the MDX community is growing fast so there's likely an extension for your favorite editor setup!

## Other tools

### Prettier

Astropad includes [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) out of the box, pre-configured with the [official Astro prettier plugin](https://github.com/withastro/prettier-plugin-astro).
