# Install Astropad with `create astro`

Ready to install Astropad? Follow our automatic or manual set-up guide to get started.

**Prerequisites**

- **Node.js** - `14.18.0`, `v16.12.0`, or higher.
- **Text editor** - We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with our [Official Astro](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode) extension.
- **Terminal** - Astro is accessed through its command-line interface (CLI).

## Run the Setup Wizard

`create-astro` is the fastest way to start a new Astro project from scratch.

```bash
# create a new project with npm
npm create astro@latest -- --template tony-sull/astropad

# create a new project with pnpm
pnpm create astro@latest -- --template tony-sull/astropad
```

## Start Astropad âœ¨

```bash
# start the dev server with npm
npm run dev

# start the dev server with pnpm
pnpm dev
```

Astropad is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and works with the usual `astro dev`, `astro build`, and `astro preview` commands. Not sure where to start? Checkout the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build) to learn more!
